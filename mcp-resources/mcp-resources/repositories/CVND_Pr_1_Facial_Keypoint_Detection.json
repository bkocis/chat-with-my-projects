Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition. Your completed code should be able to look at any image, detect faces, and predict the locations of facial keypoints on each face; examples of these keypoints are displayed below.\n\n![Facial Keypoint Detection][image1]\n\nThe project will be broken up into a few main parts in four Python notebooks, **only Notebooks 2 and 3 (and the `models.py` file) will be graded**:\n\n__Notebook 1__ : Loading and Visualizing the Facial Keypoint Data\n\n__Notebook 2__ : Defining and Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to Predict Facial Keypoints\n\n__Notebook 3__ : Facial Keypoint Detection Using Haar Cascades and your Trained CNN\n\n__Notebook 4__ : Fun Filters and Keypoint Uses\n\n\n\n## Project Instructions\n\nAll of the starting code and resources you'll need to compete this project are in this Github repository. Before you can get started coding, you'll have to make sure that you have all the libraries and dependencies required to support this project. If you have already created a `cv-nd` environment for [exercise code](https://github.com/udacity/CVND_Exercises), then you can use that environment! If not, instructions for creation and activation are below.\n\n*Note that this project does not require the use of GPU, so this repo does not include instructions for GPU setup.*\n\n\n### Local Environment Instructions\n\n1. Clone the repository, and navigate to the downloaded folder. This may take a minute or two to clone due to the included image data.\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/udacity/P1_Facial_Keypoints.git\ncd P1_Facial_Keypoints\n```\n\n2. Create (and activate) a new environment, named `cv-nd` with Python 3.6. If prompted to proceed with the install `(Proceed [y]/n)` type y.\n\n\t- __Linux__ or __Mac__: \n\t```\n\tconda create -n cv-nd python=3.6\n\tsource activate cv-nd\n\t```\n\t- __Windows__: \n\t```\n\tconda create --name cv-nd python=3.6\n\tactivate cv-nd\n\t```\n\t\n\tAt this point your command line should look something like: `(cv-nd) <User>:P1_Facial_Keypoints <user>$`. The `(cv-nd)` indicates that your environment has been activated, and you can proceed with further package installations.\n\n3. Install PyTorch and torchvision; this should install the latest version of PyTorch.\n\t\n\t- __Linux__ or __Mac__: \n\t```\n\tconda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch \n\t```\n\t- __Windows__: \n\t```\n\tconda install pytorch-cpu -c pytorch\n\tpip install torchvision\n\t```\n\n6. Install a few required pip packages, which are specified in the requirements text file (including OpenCV).\n```\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n\n### Data\n\nAll of the data you'll need to train a neural network is in the P1_Facial_Keypoints repo, in the subdirectory `data`. In this folder are training and tests set of image/keypoint data, and their respective csv files. This will be further explored in Notebook 1: Loading and Visualizing Data, and you're encouraged to look trough these folders on your own, too.\n\n\n## Notebooks\n\n1. Navigate back to the repo. (Also, your source environment should still be activated at this point.)\n```shell\ncd\ncd P1_Facial_Keypoints\n```\n\n2. Open the directory of notebooks, using the below command. You'll see all of the project files appear in your local environment; open the first notebook and follow the instructions.\n```shell\njupyter notebook\n```\n\n3. Once you open any of the project notebooks, make sure you are in the correct `cv-nd` environment by clicking `Kernel > Change Kernel > cv-nd`.\n\n__NOTE:__ While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality and answer all of the questions included in the notebook. __Unless requested, it's suggested that you do not modify code that has already been included.__\n\n\n## Evaluation\n\nYour project will be reviewed against the project [rubric](#rubric).  Review this rubric thoroughly, and self-evaluate your project before submission.  All criteria found in the rubric must meet specifications for you to pass.\n\n\n## Project Submission\n\nWhen you are ready to submit your project, collect all of your project files -- all executed notebooks, and python files -- and compress them into a single zip archive for upload.\n\nAlternatively, your submission could consist of only the **GitHub link** to your repository with all of the completed files.\n\n<a id='rubric'></a>\n## Project Rubric\n\n### `models.py`\n\n#### Specify the CNN architecture\n| Criteria       \t\t|     Meets Specifications\t        \t\t\t            | \n|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------:| \n|  Define a CNN in `models.py`. |  Define a convolutional neural network with at least one convolutional layer, i.e. self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 32, 5).
