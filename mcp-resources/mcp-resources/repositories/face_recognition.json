The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the\n[Labeled Faces in the Wild](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) benchmark.\n\nThis also provides a simple `face_recognition` command line tool that lets\nyou do face recognition on a folder of images from the command line!\n\n\n[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/face_recognition.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/face_recognition)\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ageitgey/face_recognition.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ageitgey/face_recognition)\n[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/face-recognition/badge/?version=latest)](http://face-recognition.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\n\n## Features\n\n#### Find faces in pictures\n\nFind all the faces that appear in a picture:\n\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/896692/23625227/42c65360-025d-11e7-94ea-b12f28cb34b4.png)\n\n```python\nimport face_recognition\nimage = face_recognition.load_image_file(\"your_file.jpg\")\nface_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)\n```\n\n#### Find and manipulate facial features in pictures\n\nGet the locations and outlines of each person's eyes, nose, mouth and chin.\n\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/896692/23625282/7f2d79dc-025d-11e7-8728-d8924596f8fa.png)\n\n```python\nimport face_recognition\nimage = face_recognition.load_image_file(\"your_file.jpg\")\nface_landmarks_list = face_recognition.face_landmarks(image)\n```\n\nFinding facial features is super useful for lots of important stuff. But you can also use for really stupid stuff\nlike applying [digital make-up](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/digital_makeup.py) (think 'Meitu'):\n\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/896692/23625283/80638760-025d-11e7-80a2-1d2779f7ccab.png)\n\n#### Identify faces in pictures\n\nRecognize who appears in each photo.\n\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/896692/23625229/45e049b6-025d-11e7-89cc-8a71cf89e713.png)\n\n```python\nimport face_recognition\nknown_image = face_recognition.load_image_file(\"biden.jpg\")\nunknown_image = face_recognition.load_image_file(\"unknown.jpg\")\n\nbiden_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(known_image)[0]\nunknown_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(unknown_image)[0]\n\nresults = face_recognition.compare_faces([biden_encoding], unknown_encoding)\n```\n\nYou can even use this library with other Python libraries to do real-time face recognition:\n\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/896692/24430398/36f0e3f0-13cb-11e7-8258-4d0c9ce1e419.gif)\n\nSee [this example](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/facerec_from_webcam_faster.py) for the code.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Requirements\n\n  * Python 3.3+ or Python 2.7\n  * macOS or Linux (Windows not officially supported, but might work)\n\n### Installation Options:\n\n#### Installing on Mac or Linux\n\nFirst, make sure you have dlib already installed with Python bindings:\n\n  * [How to install dlib from source on macOS or Ubuntu](https://gist.github.com/ageitgey/629d75c1baac34dfa5ca2a1928a7aeaf)\n\nThen, install this module from pypi using `pip3` (or `pip2` for Python 2):\n\n```bash\npip3 install face_recognition\n```\n\nIf you are having trouble with installation, you can also try out a\n[pre-configured VM](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/try-deep-learning-in-python-now-with-a-fully-pre-configured-vm-1d97d4c3e9b).\n\n#### Installing on Raspberry Pi 2+\n\n  * [Raspberry Pi 2+ installation instructions](https://gist.github.com/ageitgey/1ac8dbe8572f3f533df6269dab35df65)\n\n#### Installing on Windows\n\nWhile Windows isn't officially supported, helpful users have posted instuctions on how to install this library:\n\n  * [@masoudr's Windows 10 installation guide (dlib + face_recognition)](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/issues/175#issue-257710508)\n\n#### Installing a pre-configured Virtual Machine image\n\n  * [Download the pre-configured VM image](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/try-deep-learning-in-python-now-with-a-fully-pre-configured-vm-1d97d4c3e9b) (for VMware Player or VirtualBox).\n\n## Usage\n\n#### Command-Line Interface\n\nWhen you install `face_recognition`, you get a simple command-line program\ncalled `face_recognition` that you can use to recognize faces in a\nphotograph or folder full for photographs.\n\nFirst, you need to provide a folder with one picture of each person you\nalready know. There should be one image file for each person with the\nfiles named according to who is in the picture:\n\n![known](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/896692/23582466/8324810e-00df-11e7-82cf-41515eba704d.png)\n\nNext, you need a second folder with the files you want to identify:\n\n![unknown](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/896692/23582465/81f422f8-00df-11e7-8b0d-75364f641f58.png)\n\nThen in you simply run the command `face_recognition`, passing in\nthe folder of known people and the folder (or single image) with unknown\npeople and it tells you who is in each image:\n\n```bash\n$ face_recognition ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/\n\n/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama\n/face_recognition_test/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,unknown_person\n```\n\nThere's one line in the output for each face. The data is comma-separated\nwith the filename and the name of the person found.\n\nAn `unknown_person` is a face in the image that didn't match anyone in\nyour folder of known people.\n\n##### Adjusting Tolerance / Sensitivity\n\nIf you are getting multiple matches for the same person, it might be that\nthe people in your photos look very similar and a lower tolerance value\nis needed to make face comparisons more strict.\n\nYou can do that with the `--tolerance` parameter. The default tolerance\nvalue is 0.6 and lower numbers make face comparisons more strict:\n\n```bash\n$ face_recognition --tolerance 0.54 ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/\n\n/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama\n/face_recognition_test/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,unknown_person\n```\n\nIf you want to see the face distance calculated for each match in order\nto adjust the tolerance setting, you can use `--show-distance true`:\n\n```bash\n$ face_recognition --show-distance true ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/\n\n/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,Barack Obama,0.378542298956785\n/face_recognition_test/unknown_pictures/unknown.jpg,unknown_person,None\n```\n\n##### More Examples\n\nIf you simply want to know the names of the people in each photograph but don't\ncare about file names, you could do this:\n\n```bash\n$ face_recognition ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/ | cut -d ',' -f2\n\nBarack Obama\nunknown_person\n```\n\n##### Speeding up Face Recognition\n\nFace recognition can be done in parallel if you have a computer with\nmultiple CPU cores. For example if your system has 4 CPU cores, you can\nprocess about 4 times as many images in the same amount of time by using\nall your CPU cores in parallel.\n\nIf you are using Python 3.4 or newer, pass in a `--cpus <number_of_cpu_cores_to_use>` parameter:\n\n```bash\n$ face_recognition --cpus 4 ./pictures_of_people_i_know/ ./unknown_pictures/\n```\n\nYou can also pass in `--cpus -1` to use all CPU cores in your system.\n\n#### Python Module\n\nYou can import the `face_recognition` module and then easily manipulate\nfaces with just a couple of lines of code. It's super easy!\n\nAPI Docs: [https://face-recognition.readthedocs.io](https://face-recognition.readthedocs.io/en/latest/face_recognition.html).\n\n##### Automatically find all the faces in an image\n\n```python\nimport face_recognition\n\nimage = face_recognition.load_image_file(\"my_picture.jpg\")\nface_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)\n\n# face_locations is now an array listing the co-ordinates of each face!\n```\n\nSee [this example](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_faces_in_picture.py)\n to try it out.\n\nYou can also opt-in to a somewhat more accurate deep-learning-based face detection model.\n\nNote: GPU acceleration (via nvidia's CUDA library) is required for good\nperformance with this model. You'll also want to enable CUDA support\nwhen compliling `dlib`.\n\n```python\nimport face_recognition\n\nimage = face_recognition.load_image_file(\"my_picture.jpg\")\nface_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image, model=\"cnn\")\n\n# face_locations is now an array listing the co-ordinates of each face!\n```\n\nSee [this example](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_faces_in_picture_cnn.py)\n to try it out.\n\nIf you have a lot of images and a GPU, you can also\n[find faces in batches](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_faces_in_batches.py).\n\n##### Automatically locate the facial features of a person in an image\n\n```python\nimport face_recognition\n\nimage = face_recognition.load_image_file(\"my_picture.jpg\")\nface_landmarks_list = face_recognition.face_landmarks(image)\n\n# face_landmarks_list is now an array with the locations of each facial feature in each face.\n# face_landmarks_list[0]['left_eye'] would be the location and outline of the first person's left eye.\n```\n\nSee [this example](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_facial_features_in_picture.py)\n to try it out.\n\n##### Recognize faces in images and identify who they are\n\n```python\nimport face_recognition\n\npicture_of_me = face_recognition.load_image_file(\"me.jpg\")\nmy_face_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(picture_of_me)[0]\n\n# my_face_encoding now contains a universal 'encoding' of my facial features that can be compared to any other picture of a face!\n\nunknown_picture = face_recognition.load_image_file(\"unknown.jpg\")\nunknown_face_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(unknown_picture)[0]\n\n# Now we can see the two face encodings are of the same person with `compare_faces`!\n\nresults = face_recognition.compare_faces([my_face_encoding], unknown_face_encoding)\n\nif results[0] == True:\n    print(\"It's a picture of me!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"It's not a picture of me!\")\n```\n\nSee [this example](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/recognize_faces_in_pictures.py)\n to try it out.\n\n## Python Code Examples\n\nAll the examples are available [here](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/tree/master/examples).\n\n\n#### Face Detection\n\n* [Find faces in a photograph](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_faces_in_picture.py)\n* [Find faces in a photograph (using deep learning)](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_faces_in_picture_cnn.py)\n* [Find faces in batches of images w/ GPU (using deep learning)](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_faces_in_batches.py)\n\n#### Facial Features\n\n* [Identify specific facial features in a photograph](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/find_facial_features_in_picture.py)\n* [Apply (horribly ugly) digital make-up](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/digital_makeup.py)\n\n#### Facial Recognition\n\n* [Find and recognize unknown faces in a photograph based on photographs of known people](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/recognize_faces_in_pictures.py)\n* [Compare faces by numeric face distance instead of only True/False matches](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/face_distance.py)\n* [Recognize faces in live video using your webcam - Simple / Slower Version (Requires OpenCV to be installed)](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/facerec_from_webcam.py)\n* [Recognize faces in live video using your webcam - Faster Version (Requires OpenCV to be installed)](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/facerec_from_webcam_faster.py)\n* [Recognize faces in a video file and write out new video file (Requires OpenCV to be installed)](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/facerec_from_video_file.py)\n* [Recognize faces on a Raspberry Pi w/ camera](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/facerec_on_raspberry_pi.py)\n* [Run a web service to recognize faces via HTTP (Requires Flask to be installed)](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/web_service_example.py)\n\n## How Face Recognition Works\n\nIf you want to learn how face location and recognition work instead of\ndepending on a black box library, [read my article](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-part-4-modern-face-recognition-with-deep-learning-c3cffc121d78).\n\n## Caveats\n\n* The face recognition model is trained on adults and does not work very well on children. It tends to mix\n  up children quite easy using the default comparison threshold of 0.6.\n\n## Deployment to Cloud Hosts (Heroku, AWS, etc)\n\nSince `face_recognition` depends on `dlib` which is written in C++, it can be tricky to deploy an app\nusing it to a cloud hosting provider like Heroku or AWS.\n\nTo make things easier, there's an example Dockerfile in this repo that shows how to run an app built with\n`face_recognition` in a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container. With that, you should be able to deploy\nto any service that supports Docker images.\n\n## Common Issues\n\nIssue: `Illegal instruction (core dumped)` when using face_recognition or running examples.\n\nSolution: `dlib` is compiled with SSE4 or AVX support, but your CPU is too old and doesn't support that.\nYou'll need to recompile `dlib` after [making the code change outlined here](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/issues/11#issuecomment-287398611).\n\nIssue: `RuntimeError: Unsupported image type, must be 8bit gray or RGB image.` when running the webcam examples.\n\nSolution: Your webcam probably isn't set up correctly with OpenCV. [Look here for more](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/issues/21#issuecomment-287779524).\n\nIssue: `MemoryError` when running `pip2 install face_recognition`\n\nSolution: The face_recognition_models file is too big for your available pip cache memory. Instead,\ntry `pip2 --no-cache-dir install face_recognition` to avoid the issue.\n\nIssue: `AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'face_recognition_model_v1'`\n\nSolution: The version of `dlib` you have installed is too old. You need version 19.7 or newer. Upgrade `dlib`.\n\nIssue: `Attribute Error: 'Module' object has no attribute 'cnn_face_detection_model_v1'`\n\nSolution: The version of `dlib` you have installed is too old. You need version 19.7 or newer. Upgrade `dlib`.\n\nIssue: `TypeError: imread() got an unexpected keyword argument 'mode'`\n\nSolution: The version of `scipy` you have installed is too old. You need version 0.17 or newer. Upgrade `scipy`.\n\n## Thanks\n\n* Many, many thanks to [Davis King](https://github.com/davisking) ([@nulhom](https://twitter.com/nulhom))\n  for creating dlib and for providing the trained facial feature detection and face encoding models\n  used in this library.

It tends to mix\n   up children quite easy using the default comparison threshold of 0.6.\n\nDeployment to Cloud Hosts (Heroku, AWS, etc)\n--------------------------------------------\n\n| Since ``face_recognition`` depends on ``dlib`` which is written in\n  C++, it can be tricky to deploy an app\n| using it to a cloud hosting provider like Heroku or AWS.\n\n| To make things easier, there's an example Dockerfile in this repo that\n  shows how to run an app built with\n| ``face_recognition`` in a `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`__\n  container. With that, you should be able to deploy\n| to any service that supports Docker images.\n\nCommon Issues\n-------------\n\nIssue: ``Illegal instruction (core dumped)`` when using\nface\\_recognition or running examples.\n\n| Solution: ``dlib`` is compiled with SSE4 or AVX support, but your CPU\n  is too old and doesn't support that.\n| You'll need to recompile ``dlib`` after `making the code change\n  outlined\n  here <https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/issues/11#issuecomment-287398611>`__.\n\nIssue:\n``RuntimeError: Unsupported image type, must be 8bit gray or RGB image.``\nwhen running the webcam examples.\n\nSolution: Your webcam probably isn't set up correctly with OpenCV. `Look\nhere for\nmore <https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/issues/21#issuecomment-287779524>`__.\n\nIssue: ``MemoryError`` when running ``pip2 install face_recognition``\n\n| Solution: The face\\_recognition\\_models file is too big for your\n  available pip cache memory. Instead,\n| try ``pip2 --no-cache-dir install face_recognition`` to avoid the\n  issue.\n\nIssue:\n``AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'face_recognition_model_v1'``\n\nSolution: The version of ``dlib`` you have installed is too old. You\nneed version 19.7 or newer. Upgrade ``dlib``.\n\nIssue:\n``Attribute Error: 'Module' object has no attribute 'cnn_face_detection_model_v1'``\n\nSolution: The version of ``dlib`` you have installed is too old. You\nneed version 19.7 or newer. Upgrade ``dlib``.\n\nIssue: ``TypeError: imread() got an unexpected keyword argument 'mode'``\n\nSolution: The version of ``scipy`` you have installed is too old. You\nneed version 0.17 or newer. Upgrade ``scipy``.\n\nThanks\n------\n\n-  Many, many thanks to `Davis King <https://github.com/davisking>`__\n   (`@nulhom <https://twitter.com/nulhom>`__)\n   for creating dlib and for providing the trained facial feature\n   detection and face encoding models\n   used in this library.
