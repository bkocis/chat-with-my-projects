However, when using MCMC / Bayesian samplers like JAGS or Stan in R, we often have to translate this data into a form the sampler understands, and then after running the model, translate the resulting sample (or predictions) into a more tidy format for use with other R functions. `tidybayes` aims to simplify these two common (often tedious) operations:\n\n-   **Composing data** for use with the sampler. This often means translating data from a `data.frame` into a `list` , making sure `factors` are encoded as numerical data, adding variables to store the length of indices, etc. This package helps automate these operations using the `compose_data` function, which automatically handles data types like `numeric`, `logical`, `factor`, and `ordinal`, and allows easy extensions for converting other datatypes into a format the sampler understands by providing your own implementation of the generic `as_data_list`.\n\n-   **Extracting tidy samples** from the sampler. This often means extracting indices from parameters with names like `\"b[1,1]\"`, `\"b[1,2]\"` into separate columns of a data frame, like `i = c(1,1,..)` and `j = c(1,2,...)`. More tediously, sometimes these indices actually correspond to levels of a factor in the original data; e.g. `\"x[1]\"` might correspond to a value of `x` for the first level of some factor. We provide several straightforward ways to convert samples of a variable with indices into useful long-format (\"[tidy](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html)\") data frames, with automatic back-conversion of common data types (factors, logicals) using the `spread_samples` and `gather_sampels` functions, including automatic recovery of factor levels corresponding to variable indices. In most cases this kind of long-format data is much easier to use with other data-manipulation and plotting packages (e.g., `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggplot2`) than the format provided by default from the sampler.\n\n`tidybayes` also provides some additional functionality for data manipulation and visualization tasks common to many models:\n\n-   **Extracting tidy fits and predictions** from models. For models like those provided by `rstanarm` and `brms`, `tidybayes` provides a tidy analog of the `fitted` and `predict` functions, called `add_fitted_samples` and `add_predicted_samples`. These functions are modeled after the `modelr::add_predictions` function, and turn a grid of predictions into a long-format data frame of samples from either the fits or predictions from a model. These functions make it straightforward to generate arbitrary fit lines from a model.\n\n-   **Summarizing posterior distributions** from models. The `point_interval` family of functions (`mean_qi`, `median_qi`, `mode_hdi`, etc) are methods for generating estimates and intervals that are designed with tidy workflows in mind. They can generate estimates plus an arbitrary number of probability intervals *from* tidy data frames of samples, they *return* tidy data frames, and they **respect data frame groups**.\n\n-   **Visualizing posteriors**. The focus on tidy data makes the output from tidybayes easy to visualize using `ggplot`. Existing `geom`s (like `geom_pointrange` and `geom_linerange`) can give useful output, but `tidybayes` also includes several geoms to simplify common combinations of `stats` and `geoms` with sensible defaults suitable for visualizing posterior estimates and intervals (`geom_pointinterval`, `geom_pointintervalh`, `stat_pointinterval`, `stat_pointintervalh`), visualizing densities with point estimates and intervals (\"eye plots\", `geom_eye` and `geom_eyeh`; or \"half-eye plots\", `geom_halfeyeh`), and visualizing fit lines with an arbitrary number of uncertainty bands (`geom_lineribbon` and `stat_lineribbon`). Combining the base-R `quantile` function with `geom_dotplot` also facilitates the contruction of quantile dotplots of posteriors (see example in this document).\n\n-   **Comparing a variable across levels of a factor**, which often means first generating pairs of levels of a factor (according to some desired set of comparisons) and then computing a function over the value of the comparison variable for those pairs of levels. Assuming your data is in the format returned by `spread_samples`, the `compare_levels` function allows comparison across levels to be made easily.\n\nFinally, `tidybayes` aims to fit into common workflows through compatibility with other packages:\n\n-   **Compatibility with other tidy packages**. Default column names in the output have also been chosen for compatibility with `broom::tidy`, which makes comparison with estimates from non-Bayesian models straightforward.\n\n-   **Compatibility with non-tidy packages**. The `unspread_samples` and `ungather_samples` functions invert `spread_samples` and `gather_samples`, aiding compatiblity with other Bayesian plotting packages (notably `bayesplot`). The `gather_emmeans_samples` function turns the output from `emmeans::emmeans` (formerly `lsmeans`) into long-format data frames (when applied to supported model types, like `MCMCglmm` and `rstanarm` models).\n\nSupported model types\n---------------------\n\n`tidybayes` aims to support a variety of models with a uniform interface. Currently supported models include [rstan](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rstan), [coda::mcmc and coda::mcmc.list](https://cran.r-project.org/package=coda), [runjags](https://cran.r-project.org/package=runjags), [rstanarm](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rstanarm), [brms](https://cran.r-project.org/package=brms), [MCMCglmm](https://cran.r-project.org/package=MCMCglmm), and anything with its own `as.mcmc.list` implementation. If you install the [tidybayes.rethinking](https://github.com/mjskay/tidybayes.rethinking) package, models from the [rethinking](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking) package are also supported.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n`tidybayes` is not yet on CRAN, but I am in the process of preparing a CRAN submission. You can track progress towards the CRAN submission at the [CRAN Milestone](https://github.com/mjskay/tidybayes/milestone/1).\n\nIn the mean time, you can install the latest development version from GitHub with these R commands:\n\n``` r\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\ndevtools::install_github(\"mjskay/tidybayes\")\n```\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nThis example shows the use of tidybayes with the Stan modeling language; however, tidybayes supports many other samplers and models, such as JAGS, brm, rstanarm, and (theoretically) any model type supported by `coda::as.mcmc.list`.\n\n``` r\nlibrary(magrittr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggstance)\nlibrary(rstan)\nlibrary(tidybayes)\nlibrary(emmeans)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(brms)\nlibrary(modelr)\nlibrary(forcats)\n```\n\nImagine this dataset:\n\n``` r\nset.seed(5)\nn = 10\nn_condition = 5\nABC =\n  data_frame(\n    condition = rep(c(\"A\",\"B\",\"C\",\"D\",\"E\"), n),\n    response = rnorm(n * 5, c(0,1,2,1,-1), 0.5)\n  )\n\nABC %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = response, y = condition)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  ylab(\"condition\")\n```\n\n![](README_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)\n\nA hierarchical model of this data might estimate an overall mean across the conditions (`overall_mean`), the standard deviation of the condition means (`condition_mean_sd`), the mean within each condition (`condition_mean[condition]`) and the standard deviation of the responses given a condition mean (`response_sd`):\n\n``` stan\ndata {\n  int<lower=1> n;\n  int<lower=1> n_condition;\n  int<lower=1, upper=n_condition> condition[n];\n  real response[n];\n}\nparameters {\n  real overall_mean;\n  vector[n_condition] condition_zoffset;\n  real<lower=0> response_sd;\n  real<lower=0> condition_mean_sd;\n}\ntransformed parameters {\n  vector[n_condition] condition_mean;\n  condition_mean = overall_mean + condition_zoffset * condition_mean_sd;\n}\nmodel {\n  response_sd ~ cauchy(0, 1);         // => half-cauchy(0, 1)\n  condition_mean_sd ~ cauchy(0, 1);   // => half-cauchy(0, 1)\n  overall_mean ~ normal(0, 5);\n  condition_zoffset ~ normal(0, 1);   // => condition_mean ~ normal(overall_mean, condition_mean_sd)\n  for (i in 1:n) {\n    response[i] ~ normal(condition_mean[condition[i]], response_sd);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Composing data for input to model: `compose_data`\n\nWe have compiled and loaded this model into the variable `ABC_stan`. Rather than munge the data into a format Stan likes ourselves, we will use the `tidybayes::compose_data` function, which takes our `ABC` data frame and automatically generates a list of the following elements:\n\n-   `n`: number of observations in the data frame\n-   `n_condition`: number of levels of the condition factor\n-   `condition`: a vector of integers indicating the condition of each observation\n-   `response`: a vector of observations\n\nSo we can skip right to modeling:\n\n``` r\nm = sampling(ABC_stan, data = compose_data(ABC), control = list(adapt_delta=0.99))\n```\n\n### Getting tidy samples from the model: `spread_samples`\n\nWe decorate the fitted model using `tidybayes::recover_types`, which will ensure that numeric indices (like `condition`) are back-translated back into factors when we extract data:\n\n``` r\nm %<>% recover_types(ABC)\n```\n\nNow we can extract parameters of interest using `spread_samples`, which automatically parses indices, converts them back into their original format, and turns them into data frame columns. This function accepts a symbolic specification of Stan variables using the same syntax you would to index columns in Stan. For example, we can extract the condition means and the residual standard deviation:\n\n``` r\nm %>%\n  spread_samples(condition_mean[condition], response_sd) %>%\n  head(15)  # just show the first few rows\n```\n\n|  .chain|  .iteration| condition |  condition\\_mean|  response\\_sd|\n|-------:|-----------:|:----------|----------------:|-------------:|\n|       1|           1| A         |       -0.0488381|     0.5824056|\n|       1|           1| B         |        1.1920197|     0.5824056|\n|       1|           1| C         |        1.8984306|     0.5824056|\n|       1|           1| D         |        0.9617923|     0.5824056|\n|       1|           1| E         |       -0.8784776|     0.5824056|\n|       1|           2| A         |        0.1930336|     0.5961389|\n|       1|           2| B         |        1.0703175|     0.5961389|\n|       1|           2| C         |        1.9749954|     0.5961389|\n|       1|           2| D         |        1.1242398|     0.5961389|\n|       1|           2| E         |       -1.0909016|     0.5961389|\n|       1|           3| A         |        0.2633968|     0.5559389|\n|       1|           3| B         |        0.7562821|     0.5559389|\n|       1|           3| C         |        1.5831328|     0.5559389|\n|       1|           3| D         |        1.1647897|     0.5559389|\n|       1|           3| E         |       -0.8511654|     0.5559389|\n\nThe condition numbers are automatically turned back into text (\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", ...) and split into their own column. A long-format data frame is returned with a row for every iteration × every combination of indices across all variables given to `spread_samples`; for example, because `response_sd` here is not indexed by `condition`, within the same iteration it has the same value for each row corresponding to a different `condition` (some other formats supported by `tidybayes` are discussed in `vignette(\"tidybayes\")`; in particular, the format returned by `gather_samples`).\n\n### Plotting posteriors as eye plots: `geom_eye` / `geom_eyeh`\n\nAutomatic splitting of indices into columns makes it easy to plot the condition means here. We will employ the `tidybayes::geom_eyeh` geom (horizontal version of `tidybayes::geom_eye`), which combines a violin plot of the posterior density, mean, and 95% quantile interval to give an \"eye plot\" of the posterior. The point and interval types are customizable using the `point_interval` family of functions. A \"half-eye\" plot (non-mirrored density) is also available as `tidybayes::geom_halfeyeh`.\n\n``` r\nm %>%\n  spread_samples(condition_mean[condition]) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = condition_mean, y = condition)) +\n  geom_eyeh()\n```\n\n![](README_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)\n\nOr one can employ the similar \"half-eye\" plot:\n\n``` r\nm %>%\n  spread_samples(condition_mean[condition]) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = condition_mean, y = condition)) +\n  geom_halfeyeh()\n```\n\n![](README_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)\n\n### Plotting posteriors as quantile dotplots\n\nIntervals are nice if the alpha level happens to line up with whatever inference you are trying to make, but getting a shape of the posterior is better (hence eye plots, above). On the other hand, making inferences from density plots is imprecise (ratio of area estimation is a hard perceptual task). Reasoning about probability in frequency formats is easier, motivating [quantile dotplots](https://github.com/mjskay/when-ish-is-my-bus/blob/master/quantile-dotplots.md), which also allow precise estimation of arbitrary intervals (down to the dot resolution of the plot, here 100):\n\n``` r\nm %>%\n  spread_samples(condition_mean[condition]) %>%\n  do(data_frame(condition_mean = quantile(.$condition_mean, ppoints(100)))) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = condition_mean)) +\n  geom_dotplot(binwidth = .04) +\n  facet_grid(fct_rev(condition) ~ .) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL)\n```\n\n![](README_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)\n\nThe idea is to get away from thinking about the posterior as indicating one canonical point or interval, but instead to represent it as (say) 100 approximately equally likely points.\n\n### Model comparison via compatibility with `broom`\n\nThe output of the `tidybayes::mean_qi` function (and other `point_interval` functions) is compatible with `broom::tidy`, so we can compare parameter estimates easily to models supported by `broom`.\n\nFor example, let's compare to ordinary least squares (OLS) regression:\n\n``` r\nlinear_estimates = \n  lm(response ~ condition, data = ABC) %>% \n  emmeans(~ condition) %>% \n  tidy() %>%\n  mutate(model = \"OLS\")\nlinear_estimates\n```\n\n| condition |    estimate|  std.error|   df|    conf.low|   conf.high| model |\n|:----------|-----------:|----------:|----:|-----------:|-----------:|:------|\n| A         |   0.1815842|   0.173236|   45|  -0.1673310|   0.5304993| OLS   |\n| B         |   1.0142144|   0.173236|   45|   0.6652993|   1.3631296| OLS   |\n| C         |   1.8745839|   0.173236|   45|   1.5256687|   2.2234990| OLS   |\n| D         |   1.0271794|   0.173236|   45|   0.6782642|   1.3760946| OLS   |\n| E         |  -0.9352260|   0.173236|   45|  -1.2841411|  -0.5863108| OLS   |\n\nThe output from `mean_qi` when given a single parameter uses `conf.low` and `conf.high` for interval names so that it lines up with `tidy`:\n\n``` r\nbayes_estimates = m %>%\n  spread_samples(condition_mean[condition]) %>%\n  mean_qi(estimate = condition_mean) %>%\n  mutate(model = \"Bayes\")\nbayes_estimates\n```\n\n| condition |    estimate|    conf.low|   conf.high|  .prob| model |\n|:----------|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|------:|:------|\n| A         |   0.1932542|  -0.1374798|   0.5480979|   0.95| Bayes |\n| B         |   1.0054696|   0.6559603|   1.3464413|   0.95| Bayes |\n| C         |   1.8387243|   1.4854153|   2.1840286|   0.95| Bayes |\n| D         |   1.0128392|   0.6541362|   1.3738020|   0.95| Bayes |\n| E         |  -0.8927952|  -1.2404690|  -0.5443226|   0.95| Bayes |\n\nThis makes it easy to bind the two estimates together and plot them:\n\n``` r\nbind_rows(linear_estimates, bayes_estimates) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = condition, x = estimate, xmin = conf.low, xmax = conf.high, color = model)) +\n  geom_pointrangeh(position = position_dodgev(height = .3))\n```\n\n![](README_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)\n\nShrinkage towards the overall mean is visible in the Bayesian estimates.\n\nComptability with `broom::tidy` also gives compatibility with `dotwhisker::dwplot`:\n\n``` r\nbind_rows(linear_estimates, bayes_estimates) %>%\n  rename(term = condition) %>%\n  dotwhisker::dwplot()\n```\n\n![](README_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)\n\n### Posterior prediction and complex custom plots\n\nThe tidy data format returned by `spread_samples` also facilitates additional computation on parameters followed by the construction of more complex custom plots. For example, we can generate posterior predictions easily, and use the `.prob` argument (passed intervally to `mean_qi`) to generate any number of intervals from the posterior predictions, then plot them alongside parameter estimates and the data:\n\n``` r\nm %>%\n  spread_samples(condition_mean[condition], response_sd) %>%\n  mutate(pred = rnorm(n(), condition_mean, response_sd)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = condition)) +\n  \n  # posterior predictive intervals\n  stat_intervalh(aes(x = pred), .prob = c(.5, .8, .95)) +\n  scale_color_brewer() +\n  \n  # mean and quantile intervals of condition mean\n  stat_pointintervalh(aes(x = condition_mean), .prob = c(.66, .95), position = position_nudge(y = -0.2)) +\n  \n  # data\n  geom_point(aes(x = response), data = ABC)\n```\n\n![](README_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)\n\nThis plot shows 66% and 95% quantile credible intervals of posterior mean for each condition (point + black line); 95%, 80%, and 50% posterior predictive intervals (blue); and the data.\n\n### Fit curves\n\nFor models that support it (like `rstanarm` and `brms` models), We can also use the `add_fitted_samples` or `add_predicted_samples` functions to generate posterior fits or predictions. Combined with the functions from the `modelr` package, this makes it easy to generate fit curves.\n\nLet's fit a slightly naive model to miles per gallon versus horsepower in the `mtcars` dataset:\n\n``` r\nm_mpg = brm(mpg ~ log(hp), data = mtcars, family = lognormal)\n```\n\nNow we will use `modelr::data_grid`, `tidybayes::add_predicted_samples`, and `tidybayes::stat_lineribbon` to generate a fit curve with multiple probability bands:\n\n``` r\nmtcars %>%\n  data_grid(hp = seq_range(hp, n = 100)) %>%\n  add_predicted_samples(m_mpg) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = hp)) +\n  stat_lineribbon(aes(y = pred), .prob = c(.99, .95, .8, .5)) +\n  geom_point(aes(y = mpg), data = mtcars) +\n  scale_fill_brewer()\n```\n\n![](README_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)\n\n`stat_lineribbon(aes(y = pred), .prob = c(.99, .95, .8, .5))` is one of several shortcut geoms that simplify common combinations of `tidybayes` functions and `ggplot` goems. It is roughly equivalent to the following:\n\n``` r\n  stat_summary(\n    aes(y = pred, fill = forcats::fct_rev(ordered(...prob..)), group = -...prob..), \n    geom = \"ribbon\", fun.data = median_qi, fun.args = list(.prob = c(.99, .95, .8, .5))\n  ) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = pred), fun.y = median, geom = \"line\", color = \"red\", size = 1.25)\n```\n\nBecause this is all tidy data, if you wanted to build a model with interactions among different categorical variables (say a different curve for automatic and manula transmissions), you can easily generate predictions faceted over that variable (say, different curves for different transmission types). Then you could use the existing faceting features built in to ggplot to plot them.\n\nSuch a model might be:\n\n``` r\nm_mpg_am = brm(mpg ~ log(hp)*am, data = mtcars, family = lognormal)\n```\n\nThen we can generate and plot predictions as before (differences from above are highlighted as comments):\n\n``` r\nmtcars %>%\n  data_grid(hp = seq_range(hp, n = 101), am) %>%    # add am to the prediction grid\n  add_predicted_samples(m_mpg_am) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) +\n  stat_lineribbon(aes(y = pred), .prob = c(.99, .95, .8, .5)) +\n  geom_point(data = mtcars) +\n  scale_fill_brewer() +\n  facet_wrap(~ am)                                  # facet by am\n```\n\n![](README_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png)\n\nOr, if you would like overplotted posterior fit lines, you can instead use `tidybayes::add_fitted_samples` to get samples from fit lines (instead of predictions), select some reasonable number of them (say `n = 100`), and then plot them:\n\n``` r\nmtcars %>%\n  data_grid(hp = seq_range(hp, n = 101), am) %>%\n  add_fitted_samples(m_mpg_am, n = 100) %>%         # sample 100 fits from the posterior\n  ggplot(aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = estimate, group = .iteration), alpha = 0.2, color = \"red\") +\n  geom_point(data = mtcars) +\n  facet_wrap(~ am)\n```\n\n![](README_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png)\n\nSee `vignette(\"tidybayes\")` for a variety of additional examples and more explanation of how it works.\n\nFeedback, issues, and contributions\n-----------------------------------\n\nI welcome feedback, suggestions, issues, and contributions!

However,\nwhen using MCMC / Bayesian samplers like JAGS or Stan in R, we often have\nto translate this data into a form the sampler understands, and then after\nrunning the model, translate the resulting sample (or predictions) into a more tidy\nformat for use with other R functions.  `tidybayes` aims to simplify these \ntwo common (often tedious) operations:\n\n* __Composing data__ for use with the sampler. This often means translating\n  data from a `data.frame` into a `list` , making sure `factors` are encoded as\n  numerical data, adding variables to store the length of indices, etc. This\n  package helps automate these operations using the `compose_data` function, which\n  automatically handles data types like `numeric`, `logical`, `factor`, and `ordinal`, \n  and allows easy extensions for converting other datatypes into a format the\n  sampler understands by providing your own implementation of the generic `as_data_list`.\n\n* __Extracting tidy samples__ from the sampler. This often means extracting indices\n  from parameters with names like `\"b[1,1]\"`, `\"b[1,2]\"` into separate columns\n  of a data frame, like `i = c(1,1,..)` and `j = c(1,2,...)`. More tediously,\n  sometimes these indices actually correspond to levels of a factor in the original\n  data; e.g. `\"x[1]\"` might correspond to a value of `x` for the first level of\n  some factor. We provide several straightforward ways to convert samples of a\n  variable with indices into useful long-format \n  (\"[tidy](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html)\") \n  data frames, with automatic back-conversion of common data types (factors, logicals)\n  using the `spread_samples` and `gather_sampels` functions, including automatic \n  recovery of factor levels corresponding to variable indices. In most cases this\n  kind of long-format data is much easier to use with other data-manipulation and \n  plotting packages (e.g., `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggplot2`) than the format provided \n  by default from the sampler.\n  \n`tidybayes` also provides some additional functionality for data manipulation\nand visualization tasks common to many models:\n\n* __Extracting tidy fits and predictions__ from models. For models like those\n  provided by `rstanarm` and `brms`, `tidybayes` provides a tidy analog of the\n  `fitted` and `predict` functions, called `add_fitted_samples` and \n  `add_predicted_samples`. These functions are modeled after the `modelr::add_predictions`\n  function, and turn a grid of predictions into a long-format data frame of\n  samples from either the fits or predictions from a model. These functions make\n  it straightforward to generate arbitrary fit lines from a model.\n  \n* __Summarizing posterior distributions__ from models. The `point_interval`\n  family of functions (`mean_qi`, `median_qi`, `mode_hdi`, etc) are methods \n  for generating estimates and intervals that are designed with tidy workflows \n  in mind. They can generate estimates plus an arbitrary number of probability \n  intervals *from* tidy data frames of samples, they *return* tidy data frames,\n  and they **respect data frame groups**.\n\n* __Visualizing posteriors__. The focus on tidy data makes the output from tidybayes\n  easy to visualize using `ggplot`. Existing `geom`s (like `geom_pointrange` and \n  `geom_linerange`) can give useful output, but `tidybayes` also includes several\n  geoms to simplify common combinations of `stats` and `geoms` with sensible\n  defaults suitable for visualizing posterior estimates and intervals (`geom_pointinterval`,\n  `geom_pointintervalh`, `stat_pointinterval`, `stat_pointintervalh`), visualizing\n  densities with point estimates and intervals (\"eye plots\", `geom_eye` and `geom_eyeh`;\n  or \"half-eye plots\", `geom_halfeyeh`), and visualizing fit lines with an arbitrary \n  number of uncertainty bands (`geom_lineribbon` and `stat_lineribbon`). Combining the\n  base-R `quantile` function with `geom_dotplot` also facilitates the contruction\n  of quantile dotplots of posteriors (see example in this document).\n\n* __Comparing a variable across levels of a factor__, which often means first\n  generating pairs of levels of a factor (according to some desired set of \n  comparisons) and then computing a function over the value of the comparison\n  variable for those pairs of levels. Assuming your data is in the format\n  returned by `spread_samples`, the `compare_levels` function allows comparison\n  across levels to be made easily.\n\nFinally, `tidybayes` aims to fit into common workflows through compatibility with\nother packages:\n\n* __Compatibility with other tidy packages__. Default column names in the output \n  have also been chosen for compatibility with `broom::tidy`, which \n  makes comparison with estimates from non-Bayesian models straightforward.\n  \n* __Compatibility with non-tidy packages__. The `unspread_samples` and \n  `ungather_samples` functions invert `spread_samples` and `gather_samples`, \n  aiding compatiblity with other Bayesian plotting packages (notably `bayesplot`).\n  The `gather_emmeans_samples` function turns the output from `emmeans::emmeans`\n  (formerly `lsmeans`) into long-format data frames (when applied to supported \n  model types, like `MCMCglmm` and `rstanarm` models).\n\n  \n\n## Supported model types\n\n`tidybayes` aims to support a variety of models with a uniform interface. Currently supported models include [rstan](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rstan), [coda::mcmc and coda::mcmc.list](https://cran.r-project.org/package=coda), [runjags](https://cran.r-project.org/package=runjags), [rstanarm](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rstanarm), [brms](https://cran.r-project.org/package=brms), [MCMCglmm](https://cran.r-project.org/package=MCMCglmm), and anything with its own `as.mcmc.list` implementation. If you install the [tidybayes.rethinking](https://github.com/mjskay/tidybayes.rethinking) package, models from the [rethinking](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking) package are also supported.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n`tidybayes` is not yet on CRAN, but I am in the process of preparing a CRAN submission. You can track progress towards the CRAN submission at the [CRAN Milestone](https://github.com/mjskay/tidybayes/milestone/1).\n\nIn the mean time, you can install the latest development version from GitHub with these R\ncommands:\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\ndevtools::install_github(\"mjskay/tidybayes\")\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nThis example shows the use of tidybayes with the Stan modeling language; however, tidybayes supports many other samplers and models, such as JAGS, brm, rstanarm, and (theoretically) any model type supported by `coda::as.mcmc.list`.\n\n```{r setup, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}\nlibrary(magrittr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggstance)\nlibrary(rstan)\nlibrary(tidybayes)\nlibrary(emmeans)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(brms)\nlibrary(modelr)\nlibrary(forcats)\n```\n\n```{r hidden_options, include=FALSE}\nrstan_options(auto_write = TRUE)\noptions(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())\n\n#ggplot options\ntheme_set(theme_light())\n\n#misc options\noptions(width = 90)\n```\n\nImagine this dataset:\n\n```{r}\nset.seed(5)\nn = 10\nn_condition = 5\nABC =\n  data_frame(\n    condition = rep(c(\"A\",\"B\",\"C\",\"D\",\"E\"), n),\n    response = rnorm(n * 5, c(0,1,2,1,-1), 0.5)\n  )\n\nABC %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = response, y = condition)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  ylab(\"condition\")\n```\n\nA hierarchical model of this data might estimate an overall mean across the conditions (`overall_mean`), the standard deviation of the condition means (`condition_mean_sd`), the mean within each condition (`condition_mean[condition]`) and the standard deviation of the responses given a condition mean (`response_sd`):\n\n```{stan, output.var=\"ABC_stan\"}\ndata {\n  int<lower=1> n;\n  int<lower=1> n_condition;\n  int<lower=1, upper=n_condition> condition[n];\n  real response[n];\n}\nparameters {\n  real overall_mean;\n  vector[n_condition] condition_zoffset;\n  real<lower=0> response_sd;\n  real<lower=0> condition_mean_sd;\n}\ntransformed parameters {\n  vector[n_condition] condition_mean;\n  condition_mean = overall_mean + condition_zoffset * condition_mean_sd;\n}\nmodel {\n  response_sd ~ cauchy(0, 1);         // => half-cauchy(0, 1)\n  condition_mean_sd ~ cauchy(0, 1);   // => half-cauchy(0, 1)\n  overall_mean ~ normal(0, 5);\n  condition_zoffset ~ normal(0, 1);   // => condition_mean ~ normal(overall_mean, condition_mean_sd)\n  for (i in 1:n) {\n    response[i] ~ normal(condition_mean[condition[i]], response_sd);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Composing data for input to model: `compose_data`\n\nWe have compiled and loaded this model into the variable `ABC_stan`. Rather than munge the data into a format Stan likes ourselves, we will use the `tidybayes::compose_data` function, which takes our `ABC` data frame and automatically generates a list of the following elements:\n\n* `n`: number of observations in the data frame\n* `n_condition`: number of levels of the condition factor\n* `condition`: a vector of integers indicating the condition of each observation\n* `response`: a vector of observations\n\nSo we can skip right to modeling:\n\n```{r}\nm = sampling(ABC_stan, data = compose_data(ABC), control = list(adapt_delta=0.99))\n```\n\n### Getting tidy samples from the model: `spread_samples`\n\nWe decorate the fitted model using `tidybayes::recover_types`, which will ensure that numeric indices (like `condition`) are back-translated back into factors when we extract data:\n\n```{r}\nm %<>% recover_types(ABC)\n```\n\nNow we can extract parameters of interest using `spread_samples`, which automatically parses indices, converts them back into their original format, and turns them into data frame columns. This function accepts a symbolic specification of Stan variables using the same syntax you would to index columns in Stan. For example, we can extract the condition means and the residual standard deviation:\n\n```{r}\nm %>%\n  spread_samples(condition_mean[condition], response_sd) %>%\n  head(15)  # just show the first few rows\n```\n\nThe condition numbers are automatically turned back into text (\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", ...) and split into their own column. A long-format data frame is returned with a row for every iteration $\\times$ every combination of indices across all variables given to `spread_samples`; for example, because `response_sd` here is not indexed by `condition`, within the same iteration it has the same value for each row corresponding to a different `condition` (some other formats supported by `tidybayes` are discussed in `vignette(\"tidybayes\")`; in particular, the format returned by `gather_samples`).\n\n\n### Plotting posteriors as eye plots: `geom_eye` / `geom_eyeh`\n\nAutomatic splitting of indices into columns makes it easy to plot the condition means here. We will employ the `tidybayes::geom_eyeh` geom (horizontal version of `tidybayes::geom_eye`), which combines a violin plot of the posterior density, mean, and 95% quantile interval to give an \"eye plot\" of the posterior. The point and interval types are customizable using the `point_interval` family of functions. A \"half-eye\" plot (non-mirrored density) is also available as `tidybayes::geom_halfeyeh`.\n\n```{r}\nm %>%\n  spread_samples(condition_mean[condition]) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = condition_mean, y = condition)) +\n  geom_eyeh()\n```\n\nOr one can employ the similar \"half-eye\" plot:\n\n```{r}\nm %>%\n  spread_samples(condition_mean[condition]) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = condition_mean, y = condition)) +\n  geom_halfeyeh()\n```\n\n### Plotting posteriors as quantile dotplots\n\nIntervals are nice if the alpha level happens to line up with whatever inference you are trying to make, but getting a shape of the posterior is better (hence eye plots, above). On the other hand, making inferences from density plots is imprecise (ratio of area estimation is a hard perceptual task). Reasoning about probability in frequency formats is easier, motivating [quantile dotplots](https://github.com/mjskay/when-ish-is-my-bus/blob/master/quantile-dotplots.md), which also allow precise estimation of arbitrary intervals (down to the dot resolution of the plot, here 100):\n\n```{r}\nm %>%\n  spread_samples(condition_mean[condition]) %>%\n  do(data_frame(condition_mean = quantile(.$condition_mean, ppoints(100)))) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = condition_mean)) +\n  geom_dotplot(binwidth = .04) +\n  facet_grid(fct_rev(condition) ~ .) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL)\n```\n\nThe idea is to get away from thinking about the posterior as indicating one canonical point or interval, but instead to represent it as (say) 100 approximately equally likely points.\n\n### Model comparison via compatibility with `broom`\n\nThe output of the `tidybayes::mean_qi` function (and other `point_interval` functions) is compatible with `broom::tidy`, so we can compare parameter estimates easily to models supported by `broom`.\n\nFor example, let's compare to ordinary least squares (OLS) regression:\n\n```{r}\nlinear_estimates = \n  lm(response ~ condition, data = ABC) %>% \n  emmeans(~ condition) %>% \n  tidy() %>%\n  mutate(model = \"OLS\")\nlinear_estimates\n```\n\nThe output from `mean_qi` when given a single parameter uses `conf.low` and `conf.high` for interval names so that it lines up with `tidy`:\n\n```{r}\nbayes_estimates = m %>%\n  spread_samples(condition_mean[condition]) %>%\n  mean_qi(estimate = condition_mean) %>%\n  mutate(model = \"Bayes\")\nbayes_estimates\n```\n\nThis makes it easy to bind the two estimates together and plot them:\n\n```{r}\nbind_rows(linear_estimates, bayes_estimates) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = condition, x = estimate, xmin = conf.low, xmax = conf.high, color = model)) +\n  geom_pointrangeh(position = position_dodgev(height = .3))\n```\n\nShrinkage towards the overall mean is visible in the Bayesian estimates.\n\nComptability with `broom::tidy` also gives compatibility with `dotwhisker::dwplot`:\n\n```{r, warning = FALSE}\nbind_rows(linear_estimates, bayes_estimates) %>%\n  rename(term = condition) %>%\n  dotwhisker::dwplot()\n```\n\n### Posterior prediction and complex custom plots\n\nThe tidy data format returned by `spread_samples` also facilitates additional computation on parameters followed by the construction of more complex custom plots. For example, we can generate posterior predictions easily, and use the `.prob` argument (passed intervally to `mean_qi`) to generate any number of intervals from the posterior predictions, then plot them alongside parameter estimates and the data:\n\n```{r}\nm %>%\n  spread_samples(condition_mean[condition], response_sd) %>%\n  mutate(pred = rnorm(n(), condition_mean, response_sd)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = condition)) +\n  \n  # posterior predictive intervals\n  stat_intervalh(aes(x = pred), .prob = c(.5, .8, .95)) +\n  scale_color_brewer() +\n  \n  # mean and quantile intervals of condition mean\n  stat_pointintervalh(aes(x = condition_mean), .prob = c(.66, .95), position = position_nudge(y = -0.2)) +\n  \n  # data\n  geom_point(aes(x = response), data = ABC)\n```\n\nThis plot shows 66% and 95% quantile credible intervals of posterior mean for each condition (point + black line); 95%, 80%, and 50% posterior predictive intervals (blue); and the data.\n\n\n### Fit curves\n\nFor models that support it (like `rstanarm` and `brms` models), We can also use the `add_fitted_samples` or `add_predicted_samples` functions to generate posterior fits or predictions. Combined with the functions from the `modelr` package, this makes it easy to generate fit curves.\n\nLet's fit a slightly naive model to miles per gallon versus horsepower in the `mtcars` dataset:\n\n```{r, results = \"hide\", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}\nm_mpg = brm(mpg ~ log(hp), data = mtcars, family = lognormal)\n```\n\nNow we will use `modelr::data_grid`, `tidybayes::add_predicted_samples`, and `tidybayes::stat_lineribbon` to generate a fit curve with multiple probability bands:\n\n```{r}\nmtcars %>%\n  data_grid(hp = seq_range(hp, n = 101)) %>%\n  add_predicted_samples(m_mpg) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = hp)) +\n  stat_lineribbon(aes(y = pred), .prob = c(.99, .95, .8, .5)) +\n  geom_point(aes(y = mpg), data = mtcars) +\n  scale_fill_brewer()\n```\n\n`stat_lineribbon(aes(y = pred), .prob = c(.99, .95, .8, .5))` is one of several shortcut geoms that simplify common combinations of `tidybayes` functions and `ggplot` goems. It is roughly equivalent to the following:\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n  stat_summary(\n    aes(y = pred, fill = forcats::fct_rev(ordered(...prob..)), group = -...prob..), \n    geom = \"ribbon\", fun.data = median_qi, fun.args = list(.prob = c(.99, .95, .8, .5))\n  ) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = pred), fun.y = median, geom = \"line\", color = \"red\", size = 1.25)\n```\n\nBecause this is all tidy data, if you wanted to build a model with interactions among different categorical variables (say a different curve for automatic and manual transmissions), you can easily generate predictions faceted over that variable (say, different curves for different transmission types). Then you could use the existing faceting features built in to ggplot to plot them.\n\nSuch a model might be:\n\n```{r, results = \"hide\", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}\nm_mpg_am = brm(mpg ~ log(hp)*am, data = mtcars, family = lognormal)\n```\n\nThen we can generate and plot predictions as before (differences from above are highlighted as comments):\n\n```{r}\nmtcars %>%\n  data_grid(hp = seq_range(hp, n = 101), am) %>%    # add am to the prediction grid\n  add_predicted_samples(m_mpg_am) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) +\n  stat_lineribbon(aes(y = pred), .prob = c(.99, .95, .8, .5)) +\n  geom_point(data = mtcars) +\n  scale_fill_brewer() +\n  facet_wrap(~ am)                                  # facet by am\n```\n\nOr, if you would like overplotted posterior fit lines, you can instead use `tidybayes::add_fitted_samples` to get samples from fit lines (instead of predictions), select some reasonable number of them (say `n = 100`), and then plot them:\n\n```{r}\nmtcars %>%\n  data_grid(hp = seq_range(hp, n = 101), am) %>%\n  add_fitted_samples(m_mpg_am, n = 100) %>%         # sample 100 fits from the posterior\n  ggplot(aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = estimate, group = .iteration), alpha = 0.2, color = \"red\") +\n  geom_point(data = mtcars) +\n  facet_wrap(~ am)\n```\n\n\nSee `vignette(\"tidybayes\")` for a variety of additional examples and more explanation of how it works.\n\n\n## Feedback, issues, and contributions\n\nI welcome feedback, suggestions, issues, and contributions!
