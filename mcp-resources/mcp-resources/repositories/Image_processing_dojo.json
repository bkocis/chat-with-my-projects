This can be done by copying the cv2*.so file from the dist-packages to the site-packages folder of the virtual environment. For example:\n\n`cp /usr/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/cv2.cpython-36m-aarch64-linux-gnu.so ~/your_virt_env_folder/YOUR_VIRT_ENV_NAME/lib/python3.6/site-packages/`\n\n\n## Example scripts:\n- Plant green area calculator \n  - detection of a defined HSV colour and calculate its area\n- Color patch shape, size and area retrieval \n\n## Interesting resources\nThe following links point to post, challenges and small project that tackle interesting aspects in the application of computer vison. \n\n- [Coca-cola can recognition](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10168686/image-processing-algorithm-improvement-for-coca-cola-can-recognition?rq=1)\n",
