Originally “FullProf” can handle multiple file refinements (by applying the same *.pcr file to\nmany diffraction pattern files), however, it does not have a feature for refinement strategy comparison and stepwise execution of refinements on single and/or multiple datasets and using several crystallographic models. The code described in this thesis\nextends “FullProf”-s functionality by accessing the refinement control file (*.pcr file) and directly modifying it programmaticaly. In this way one can test: 1) many variations of the *.pcr file onto one diffraction pattern, where the modification of the *.pcr file can be parametrized as well, 2) evaluation of many diffraction patterns all\nwith various, altered *.pcr files.\n\n### Source code\n\nThe source code is written in python 2.7, migration to python3 is in preparation. \nThe program does not require installation. \n\nRequirement:\n- python packages\n  - numpy \n  - matplotlib\n  - pandas\n- [\"Fullprof\"](https://www.ill.eu/sites/fullprof/php/downloads.html) sotfrare installed\n\nThe program is invoke by the `start_0254.py` from the command line and it is a interface for running all subroutines from the python files in the repo.\n\n",
