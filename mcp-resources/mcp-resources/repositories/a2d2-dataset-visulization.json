Description \n\nThe purpose of the application is to enable intuitive and easy slicing of a ling recoring of a drive into smaller part of interest. The visual elements (widgets, plots) are aiding in the slicing by showing the camera views, bus data, and geolocation of the car synchronized by the timestamp of the recordings. The interactive sliders set the position of the car in the scene, as well as marking the range of the slice. The \"Export Section\" button prepares the slice in a zip file stored on the hard drive (root folder of the app). \n\n\n### 2. Installation \n\nThe app was built on python 3.6.9 - the list of packages and their verison can be read in the `requirements.txt` file. Or can be installed running (`pip install -r requirements.txt`,  given that a python virtual environment had been created by `python3 -m venv ~/VENV_FOLDER/VENV_NAME`. \nThe main packages needed are: \n- bokeh (`pip install --upgrade pip; pip install bokeh`) - for the front-end server and interactive widget visualization\n- opencv ('pip in opencv-python`) - for the image processing/preprocessing\n- pyproj (`pip install pyproj`) - for geoposition coodrinate transformation web-mercator to latitude, longitude \n- pandas (`pip install pandas`) - for indexing the data \n\n\n### 3. Running the app\n\nTo rnu the app, execute the follwoing command from the current working directory that contains the `slide-image` (app name) folder:\n`bokeh serve slider-image --show` \n\nThe `--show` flag only opens the app in the default browser. Otherwise open the browser at `http://localhost:5006/slider-image`. In case you are running the app on the localhost, the default port is 5006.\n\n### 4. Furhter development and know issues \n\n#### 4.1 Zip-ing the images can take long time\nAs the slices of data can be arbitary in length, the time it takes to zip all the neccessary files can be long.  \n\n#### 4.2 What folders/camera views to pack\nCurrent version zips only the front camera images. The code that adds the left, right camera and lidar data to the zip file will be extended soon. In case only one camera view is ougth to be evaluated, there is no need to pack all views, and so redice size and time.\n\n\n## Issues\n\n- 404 image files not found \n- /static folder and js file loading https://discourse.bokeh.org/t/getting-404-error-for-embedded-bokeh-app/9993/2",
